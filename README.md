# MyFirstGitProject
This is my first "mature" attempt at making a GitHub project that I'll actually integrate with Xcode...

Project Objective:
To learn how to use GitHub.
Ultimately, like almost everything, it's all about increasing my $$$ earning potential so that it'll be truly AWESOME!

I'll be using this tool (GitHub) to facilitate my learning about Continuous Integration.
Specifically with Xcode, Xcode Server and OS X Server.
Wish me luck! (I'm wishing it upon myslef right now...)
