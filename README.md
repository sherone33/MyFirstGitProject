# MyFirstGitProject
This is my first "mature" attempt at making a GitHub project that I'll actually integrate with Xcode...

Project Objective:
To learn how to use GitHub.
Ultimately, like most things, it's all about increasing my earning potential. 

I'll be using this tool (GitHub) to facilitate my learning about Continuous Integration.
Specifically with Xcode, Xcode Server and OS X Server.
Wish me luck! (I'm wishing it upon myslef right now...)
